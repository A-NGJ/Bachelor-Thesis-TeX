\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

The recent development in the deep learning area has resulted in a significant increase in usage of artificial intelligence solutions. Recommendation algorithms, voice or face recognition, type hinting - these are only examples of technologies which are used on a everyday basis by millions. Deep Artificial Neural Networks are by far, the most robust of all machine learning algorithms capable of handling various tasks in an unprecedented manner. Thus I decided to get my hands on designing and implementing vision system for an autonomous boat which uses their full potential.

\subsection{Games}
\label{sub:intro-games}
RN nowadays is well-known due to algorithm which used to solve different games and managed to achieve a super-human performance in some.
The DQN agent designed by \emph{Google Deep Mind} was able to play 49 different Atari 2600 games (\ref{fig:Atari2600}). However, the most famous one is probably the \emph{AlphaGo} \cite{AlphaGO}  and \emph{AlphaGo Zero}. AlphaGo was trained on countless human games achieving robust performance, but it was not sufficient for the researchers. They let their new agent trained from scratch - AlphaGo Zero to play with itself and eventually beat AlphaGo 100-0.

\subsection{Robotics}
\label{sub:intro-robotics}
As stated in survey \cite{RNSurvey}, \emph{reinforcement learning offers to a robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors}. In fact, these are most of existing ones in a real world. Instead of engineering a set of deterministic movements of a robot in a controlled environment, identical or improved result can be achieved through training in a well-defined task which provides feedback measuring robot's performance. Such approach enables to train robots for performing tasks in more real world environments which are not usually fully controllable. 

\subsection{Personalized Recommendations}
\label{sub:intro-personalized-reccomendations}
News recommendation tends to be challenging due to the fact that most of the users easily get bored. Even if one clicks at the article, there is a low likelihood that it will be read to the end. Therefore Click Through Rate, which is used by many algorithms, standalone is an ineffective indicator. In order to improve the quality of recommendations and address this issue, the DQN was designed and described in \emph{DRN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for News Recommendation} \cite{DRNNewsRecommendaiton}. This method uses multiple features to determine what will be displayed to the user.
