    Reinforcement learning methods are commonly used in various areas such as: self-driving cars, trading and finance, NLP\footnote{Natural Language Processing} and many more. Q-learning is an off-policy, model-free algorithm that found numerous applications in a training of autonomous agents. With a support of Deep Neural Network to evaluate and improve action policy, Deep Q-Learning became a powerful enough tool to teach an autonomous boat how to find a route using its vision system in an environment when it was trained. This paper gives a detailed information of how it was achieved and compares different architectures of DQN applied to solve the task given in the Thesis.
